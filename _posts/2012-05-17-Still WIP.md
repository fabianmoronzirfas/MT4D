================

This site and blog is still a work in progress. In about 14 days it has to be ready.
I'm on a good way. I'm still using jekyll. I had some problems with character encoding but got rid of them. This was the hardest thing. Even tough i still don't understand ruby I will stick to jekyll.   
The site is now build on twitter bootstrap which made the layout easy and the responsiveness aswell. Unfortunatly the on press events seem to behave diffrent and the index is always filling the whole screen on small devices. ;(  
Another good thing is the site is now fully cloud based. No code from MT4D is on fabiantheblind.info. It is all stored on github.com. As soon as i get the CNAME thing working the url will also be aas if you where on fabiantheblind.info. I will incorporate the index and coding page into that layout aswell.  
So - lets get back to work.
