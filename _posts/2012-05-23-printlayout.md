================

Making a print layout never was that anoying. It feels like carving something in stone. I'm using a JavaScript to make InDesign documents from the .md files, but the markdown to InDesign paragraph styles is really buggy. Anyway. It seems like it there is a end at the end of the tunnel.    
I want to play outside againâ€¦
